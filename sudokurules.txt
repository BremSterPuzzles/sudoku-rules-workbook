• Palindromes: Digits on a grey line read the same in either direction.


• Parity Lines: Digits on the red lines alternate odd and even parity.


• Quadruples: Digits in a Quadruple circle must be placed at least once in the four cells touching that circle.

Sum Lines - Boxes
• Sum Line: Box borders split blue lines into sections, and the digits on those sections must sum to the same value.
• Sum Line: Box borders split blue lines into sections, and the digits on those sections must sum to the same value. If a line has multiple sections within a box, these sections are summed separately.
• Sum Line Variant: Box borders split blue lines into sections, and the digits on those sections must sum to the same value. If a line has multiple sections within a box, these sections are summed together.
